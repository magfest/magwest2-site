Registration opens each morning, starting on Friday, at 9:00 AM and will close each night at 12:00 AM (and 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Sunday.) Your badge may be picked up or purchased at Registration at any time we are open.



Badges can be picked up overnight at Security. If you have not purchased a badge, please purchase it online before heading to Security.

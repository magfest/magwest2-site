Super MadNES is a Los Angeles, CA based tribute to retro video games and traditional 80s heavy metal music, creating riff-oriented guitar & synth arrangements to classic NES, SNES and arcade soundtracks.

The band is releasing their 2nd full length NES themed album featuring "Castlevania III" and "Batman" this summer 2018, including tours in the east and west coast.

At MAGWest 2018, they will be performing the music from classic games such as Castlevania 3, Batman, Double Dragon, Ninja Gaiden, Megaman X and Super Ghouls ’N Ghost along with an action fueled pixelated visual show.

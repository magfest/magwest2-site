##### About Me

- - -

I live in California working as a student and aspiring artist studying at California College of the Arts on my way towards a BA in Animation.

As an artist I enjoy drawing a variety of things in a variety of styles - I'm open to all imaginations.

Aside from art and drawing, I also take great pleasure in DIY crafts, volunteering, cooking/baking, games, and television.

Making the most out of life is what I do best, and I hope to lead a successful life in my career someday with the help of my peers, family and friends.

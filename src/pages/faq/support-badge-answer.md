All individuals that purchase a supporter package will also be given an attendee badge.

While supporters will still receive a personalized swag item, supporter badges no longer exist. This prevents issues where some Supporters were given two valid badges upon registration, which is against MAGWest policy.

All supporter swag can be picked up at our Merchandise booth after you pick up your badge.

Anyone picking up a badge needs a government issued photo ID that matches the name of the badge being picked up and your date of birth.

Please ensure that you use your legal name as shown on your ID when you preregister for your badge.

If you used another name, email contact@magwest.org or use the personalized link in your confirmation email to transfer your badge to your corrected name.

On rare occasions we will accept a photo ID without a date of birth such as a high school or college ID. Please note, we do reserve the right to refuse these IDs.

Unfortunately, you will need to buy a new badge at the current price.

If you find your initial badge later, bring both to Registration and we will note that you need a refund for your second badge.

Please note, we will make every effort to process your refunds at the event, but please allow us two weeks after the event to process your refund.

If you have not received your refund at that time please email regsupport@magfest.org with your details.

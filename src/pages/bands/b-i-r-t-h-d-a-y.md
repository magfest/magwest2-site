### B/I/R/T/H/D/A/Y is a Synthwave duo from Oakland, CA, seamlessly meshing the sounds of the past, present, and future into an original take on nostalgia-fueled music.

### B/I/R/T/H/D/A/Y formed in the fall of 2016 and is comprised of Nick Galvez and Ian Cowell, who after spending time separately writing material and sending each other demos, decided to get together. They immediately hit it off, running with ideas that seemed outlandish in past projects but organic in this one. In no time they found communities near and far that were latching onto the unique and infectious music they had created.

### Their debut album, “Wolfdads”, has received critical acclaim for running the gamut from progressive rock, to electro, to jazz fusion and even chiptunes.

### Using a combination of synthesizers, guitars, and raw nerd power, B/I/R/T/H/D/A/Y is here to take you to the future the past promised you.

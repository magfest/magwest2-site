### How do you resurrect the memorable themes of classic video games from the 1980s and '90s?

### Just ask the lovable nerds of Extra Lives. The Los Angeles-based quartet of gamer-musicians isn't ready to let go of their Nintendo and Sega childhoods... and neither should you.

### Ken Christianson (bass and violin), Michael Kohl (guitar), Tim Lillis (piano and synthesizer) and Taylor Kennedy (drums and percussion) release a new performance of a classic video game tune every single Monday. Each piece is recorded live in a single take and conceived with maximum deference to the original video game composers.

### From the epic drama of Chrono Trigger's "Main Theme" to the rump-thumping funk of Sonic the Hedgehog 2's "Chemical Plant Zone," Extra Lives creates compelling soundscapes that breathe new life into VGM classics and bring listeners back to the best days of yesteryear.

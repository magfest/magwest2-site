### Super MadNES is a Los Angeles, CA based tribute to retro video games and traditional 80s heavy metal music, creating riff-oriented guitar & synth arrangements to classic NES, SNES and arcade soundtracks.

### The band is releasing their 2nd full length NES themed album featuring "Castlevania III" and "Batman" this summer 2018, including tours in the east and west coast.

### At MAGWest 2018, they will be performing the music from classic games such as Castlevania 3, Batman, Double Dragon, Ninja Gaiden, Megaman X and Super Ghouls â€™N Ghost along with an action fueled pixelated visual show.

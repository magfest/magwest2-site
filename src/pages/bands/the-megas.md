Since the year 200X (4), The Megas have strived to bring a message from Dr. Light to the people. They have chosen to transmit that message, the tale of a small blue robot named Megaman, directly into the eardrums of the general populace through the power of rock.

Composed of four mere humans with no known robot powers, The Megas previously used their face melting abilities in other rock projects including the popular punk act Agent 51, who signed with BIllie Joe Armstrong’s Adeline Records and enjoyed some tour success before disbanding. However, it was not until they rallied behind Megaman that they found a true purpose for their rock: the righteous cause of justice.

The Megas’ quest is just beginning - thus far they have unleashed the rock assault in their hometown of Los Angeles and throughout California. They’ve done two tours of the Northeastern US and have played at numerous gaming conventions and events, including the popular video game music orchestral tour Video Games Live, MAGfest, Nerdapalooza, and the mother of all conventions, the San Diego Comic Con. With a tour of the Northeast already on the books for the summer of 2009, The Megas hope to continue touring the rest of the country, the continent, and ultimately the origin of Megaman himself: Japan.

Their long awaited debut album, Get Equipped, was released in January of 2008. The band is currently working on an acoustic remix of Get Equipped, a joint EP of MM1 songs with Entertainment System, and an album based on the music of Mega Man 3!
